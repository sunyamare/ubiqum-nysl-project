# Ubiqum Sprint 1 - first week's project

It started as a simple HTML CSS website with different designs.

Then, I started using JavaScript (and some jQuery) to load content from separate html files into index.html, in order to avoid having to change common code that every page shares. It's like an SPA.
The page title and the class "active" for the menu is added dynamically after changing sites.
