        <li>
            The common interest that members of the Association share is to
            inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play.
            Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee
            whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary
            action regardless of technical soccer background, expertise,
            accomplishments or standing.

            <strong class="uppercase">Dimensions.</strong>
            FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within a
            given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should
            be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong class="uppercase">Competition Fields.</strong>
            Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum of 100
            x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations participating in the
            state competition program that are unable to provide a field that
            meets these minimum requirements must advise the State Competition
            Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field
            and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
            dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
            associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
            required to play all their games away.
