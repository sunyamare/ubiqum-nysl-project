                The common interest that members of the Association share is to
                inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair
                play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator
                or referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject
                to disciplinary action regardless of technical soccer
                background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.
