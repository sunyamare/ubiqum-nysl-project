# Ubiqum Sprint 1 - first week's project

It started as a simple HTML CSS website with different designs.

Then I added the option of choosing design 1, design 2, or my own design while viewing the page (dynamically changing the css file that's loaded).

Finally, I used jQuery and JS to load content from separate html files into index.html, in order to avoid having to change common code that every page shares.
The page title and the class "active" for the menu is added dynamically after changing sites.
